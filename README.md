# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Advanced Objectives
- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Techniques like SMOTE or class weighting to address the imbalanced nature of fraud data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilize grid search or randomized search to fine-tune model parameters.
- **Cross-Validation:** Implement cross-validation to ensure the model's performance is robust across different splits of the dataset.
- **Model Explainability:** Incorporate tools such as SHAP or LIME to explain model predictions and build trust in the fraud detection system.

## Additional Setup Instructions

1. **Install Extra Dependencies**
   In addition to the basic requirements, install:
   ```bash
   pip install imbalanced-learn shap matplotlib seaborn
